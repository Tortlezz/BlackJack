# BlackJack
A simple blackjack game on python

## **TODO**:
- ~~add split, double, insurance~~
- gracefully handling invalid input.
- ~~Exit on command w/o terminating~~
- Smoother betting (maybe out of console) and round changing (in progess)
- End of round visuals
- Sound effects for every action

## How to Play:
- Console is where you bet (after ever round)
- Click hit or stand (more functions added later)
