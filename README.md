# BlackJack
A simple blackjack game on python

## **TODO**:
- add split, double, insurance
- gracefully handling invalid input.
- other bj features that idk yet.
- Exit on command w/o terminating
- Smoother betting (maybe out of console) and round changing
- End of round visuals
- Sound effects for every action

## How to Play:
- Console is where you bet (after ever round)
- Click hit or stand (more functions added later)
